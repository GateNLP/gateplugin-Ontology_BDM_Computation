# gateplugin-Ontology_BDM_Computation

This plugin adds a right click menu item to ontology LRs to compute the BDM (balanced distance metric) scores between all pairs of concepts in the ontology and write the results to a file.  More details can be found in the GATE user guide at https://gate.ac.uk/userguide/sec:eval:bdmplugin
